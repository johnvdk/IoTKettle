# IoTKettle

I hate mornings, but I love my pour-over coffee. I designed this kettle so that when I wake up in the morning, the water is boiled by the time I wake-up. How does this work? Well I created an android app which connects via bluetooth socket to an HC-05 module. The HC-05 acts as communicator with the STM32F103 mmicrocontroller (blue pill) and when given a certain command from my phone, the module realys the command to the microcontroller and turns on a digital pin. This pin then turns on a voltage level shifter via a single BJT, some resistors, and a 5V power supply to convert it to close to 5V since the blue pill only outputs pins with 3.3V. this change in voltage is transmitted to an electric relay, connecting the kettle to the A/C power supply through the cord and wall socket.
